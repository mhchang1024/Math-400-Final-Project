## Math-400-Final-Project
Harry led group discussions, maintained direction and focus during work sessions while ensuring that output met the requirements specified in the directions, created the frameworks for the code to each solution, and narrated the group video.

Michael led troubleshooting of issues with code, helped group members run code written on other machines, maintained the team Github repository, and produced the group video.

Chad conducted the majority of initial programming and helped with refining visualizations.

Anish led the development of the algorithm for integration that uses piecewise cubic functions and assisted with debugging potential input and output issues.


The filename convention uses is 'fp' followed by the number and, if necessary, letter of the problem the code provides a solution for, followed by descriptive word(s).
1a -> fp1a_newton
1b -> fp1b_secant
1c -> fp1c_bisection
1d -> fp1d_main, fp1d_bsct, fp1d_nwtn
2 -> fp2_newton_multivariable, fp2_invJ
3 -> fp3_pw_cubic_algorithm *** not code, this is a pdf ***
4 -> fp4_damAnalysis
